# MyFrontEnd
These projects utilize HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Materialize CSS.

The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate and strengthen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Here, the HTML page contains new elements of HTML 5. 
The CSS has both 2D and 3D animations of CSS 3. 
Additionally, the Javascript takes care of logic for the app and Materialize CSS is used to deliver best UI experience.
